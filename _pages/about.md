I am applying for doctoral programs for Fall 2018, planning to focus on health policy and innovation.

I am currently a Research Assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a Harvard Kennedy School Research Affiliate. My research has focused largely on racial disparities in health outcomes among the elderly and regulatory incentives for biomedical innovation.

I graduated magna cum laude in 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Miami.
